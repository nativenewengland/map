Unaware of its native origins, the pilgrims assumed the location to be of European Christian construction and falsely mistook it as a graveyard. In the Pilgrims Journal the following is written.

""We found a great burying place, one part whereof was encompassed with a large Palazado, like a Church-yard, with yong spires foure or five yards long, set as close one by another as they could two or three foot in the ground, within it was full of Graves, some bigger, and some lesse, some were also paled about, & others had like an Indian house made over them, but not matted: those Graves were more sumptuous than those at Corne-hill, yet we digged none of them up,. but onely viewed them, and went our way; without the Palazado were graves also, but not so costl.""",,,,,,{},Forts

[^1]:Whilst we were thus ranging and searching, two of the sailors, which were newly come on the shore, by chance espied two houses which had been lately dwelt in, but the people were gone. They, having their pieces and hearing nobody, entered the houses and took out some things, and durst not stay but came again and told us. So some seven or eight of us went with them, and found how we had gone within a flight shot of them before. The houses were made with long young sapling trees, bended and both ends stuck into the ground. They were made round, like unto an arbor, and covered down to the ground with thick and well wrought mats, and the door was not over a yard high, made of a mat to open. The chimney was a wide open hole in the top, for which they had a mat to cover it close when they pleased. One might stand and go upright in them. In the midst of them were four little trunches knocked into the ground, and small sticks laid over, on which they hung their pots, and what they had to seethe. Round about the fire they lay on mats, which are their beds. The houses were double matted, for as they were matted without, so were they within, with newer and fairer mats. In the houses we found wooden bowls, trays and dishes, earthen pots, handbaskets made of crabshells wrought together, also an English pail or bucket; it wanted a bail, but it had two iron ears. There was also baskets of sundry sorts, bigger and some lesser, finer and some coarser; some were curiously wrought with black and white in pretty works, and sundry other of their household stuff. We found also two or three deer’s heads, one whereof had been newly killed, for it was still fresh. There was also a company of deer’s feet stuck up in the houses, harts’ horns, and eagles’ claws, and sundry such like things there was, also two or three baskets full of parched acorns, pieces of fish, and a piece of a broiled herring. We found also a little silk grass, and a little tobacco seed, with some other seeds which we knew not. Without was sundry bundles of flags, and sedge, bulrushes, and other stuff to make mats. There was thrust into a hollow tree two or three pieces of venison, but we thought it fitter for the dogs than for us. Some of the best things we took away with us, and left the houses standing still as they were.",,,,,,{},

Eventually the Mohicans were pushed east to the Housatonic River in what is now Massachusetts. The tribe was also catastrophically affected by diseases that the Europeans brought, which decreased their numbers greatly.

In the mid-1780s, the Stockbridge Mohican people moved to New Stockbridge near Oneida Lake, where they had been offered a tract of land. However land companies focused on profit proposed that New York State remove all Indians from within its borders, and the tribe was forced to move again, this time to the White River area in what is now Indiana.

Meanwhile, missionaries, agents from the state of New York, and commissioners from the War Department were negotiating with the Menominee and Ho- Chunk (Winnebago) for a large tract of land on which to relocate the Indigenous people from New York in what is now Wisconsin. A treaty was negotiated in 1822 and the Stockbridge Mohicans moved yet again, this time to the reservation in Wisconsin, where they still reside today.[^1]

It is said the mountain is the carcass of a human-eating giant beaver who lived in a lake now occupied by the Connecticut River. The people complained to the god Hobomok that the beaver was greedy, and consuming all their resources. In response Hobomok decided to kill the beaver with a club he fashioned from a large tree. After the struggle, the beaver died, sank to the bottom of the lake, turned to stone, and became what is now Wequamps Mountain. 

Geological evidence shows that 15,000 years ago the area was infact a massive post-glacial lake and that a now extinct species of giant beaver as big as black bears once inhabited the area about the same time ",10,0,0,0,,,Mountains
